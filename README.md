# ðŸ¤– Daily Learnings on Agentic AI

Welcome to my learning journal on **Agentic AI**. This repository is where I share my daily insights, notes, code, and resources as I explore the world of autonomous, goal-driven AI agents.

## ðŸ§  What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to behave like **autonomous agents** â€” capable of setting goals, making decisions, planning tasks, and executing actions with minimal human intervention.

Key concepts include:
- Autonomous Agents
- Task Planning and Execution
- LLM-based Agents (e.g. AutoGPT, BabyAGI, LangGraph)
- Memory and Context Handling
- Tool Use and API Calling

## ðŸ“† Daily Learning Format

Each day, I will upload a folder or file containing:
- Concepts I learned
- Code experiments
- Diagrams or workflows
- Useful resources or links
- Personal reflections or question
